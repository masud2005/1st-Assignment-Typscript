## Understanding TypeScript Better: Two Core Concepts Explained

TypeScript helps us write safer and more maintainable JavaScript code by adding type support. In this post, weâ€™ll explore two important TypeScript topics that are often asked in interviews and used in real projects.

### 1. What are some differences between **interfaces** and **types** in TypeScript?

Both **interfaces** and **type aliases** are used to describe the shape of objects, but they have some key differences:

#### Common Differences:

| Feature            | Interface                              | Type Alias                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Usage              | Best for defining object shapes         | Can define objects, unions, tuples etc.|
| Extendable         | Can be extended with `extends`          | Can be combined using `&`              |
| Declaration Merging| Supports merging with same name         | Does not support merging               |

#### Example:

```ts
// Interface
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Type
type Admin = {
  name: string;
  role: string;
};

// Combining types
type SuperUser = User & Admin;
```

#### When to use what?

- Use **interface** if you're only defining object shapes.
- Use **type** when working with unions, tuples, or need advanced combinations.

### 2. Example of **union** and **intersection** types in TypeScript

There are two main ways to combine types in TypeScript:

- **Union type (`|`)** means a value can be one of several types.

- **Intersection type (`&`)** means a value has all properties from multiple types.

#### Union Type Example:
```ts
type Status = "success" | "error" | "loading";

function showStatus(status: Status) {
  console.log("Status is:", status);
}

showStatus("success");
```

#### Intersection Type Example:
```ts
type Name = { name: string };
type Age = { age: number };

type Person = Name & Age;

const person: Person = {
  name: "Masud",
  age: 25
};
```

#### When to use what?
- Use **union types** when a value can be one of several types.
- Use **intersection types** when you want to combine multiple types into one.

## Conclusion

Understanding `interface` vs `type` and `union` vs `intersection` will help you write better and safer TypeScript code. These are simple but powerful tools for building clear and scalable applications.
